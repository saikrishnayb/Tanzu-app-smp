/**
 * Exception class the application can throw to indicate a business rule has been violated in a way the application did not expect.
 * This counts as a critical HumanReadableException, so getting one of these should not happen unless there's a programming bug.
 * 
 * Generally, these should be thrown by the domain layer (or rarely, the service layer) when checking preconditions and ensuring the domain objects are always in a valid state.
 * 
 * The difference between this and an {@link AppValidationException} is that this one indicates a programming bug and a condition that should never happen,
 * 	whereas the other one indicates a validation that we expected to do on the server did not pass.
