The files in this directory are only for pages using the v1 template that require a newer jQuery version, and so they use jQuery.noConflict to load two (or more versions of jQuery and other libraries).
This is generally bad practice, and new pages should be written using the v2 page template and kept to a single jQuery version.
These files are only here for the continued functioning of the pages that already use them as of 2020-05-14.

I repeat, DO NOT USE THESE FILES IN NEW PAGES!!!
Thank you.
